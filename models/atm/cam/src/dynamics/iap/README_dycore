1 flexib.F90     to set the following flags of time integration and Coriolis force calculations 
       zmh_nlitti1   for tend_lin
       zmh_nlitti2   for tend_adv
       zmh_Coriolis
       wbd_nlitti1   for tend_lin with leaping format
       wbd_nlitti2   for tend_adv with leaping format

2. nlitti.F90    to modify time integration scheme and add usingleaping format switch
3. tend_lin2.F90 modified from tend_lin  zmh
	add period DU,DV wbd
4. tend_adv2.F90 modified from tend_adv  zmh
5. Dyn_const.F90 added leaping format parameter  CH
	   sine_devide,cos_deglat,k_temp,cos_70,cos_45
6. Filt.F90 added the adaptive filter function and no fft filter for leaping format  wbd & CH
	   FILTER_noFFT no fft filter in the high latitude for leaping format
	   FILTER_9_13 the adaptive filter in the high latitude for 1.4*1.4 resolution
	   FILTER_all13 the adaptive filter in the high latitude for 0.5*0.5 resolution
7. FILT2Dadaptive.F90 added the switch to select the different filter methods  wbd & CH
	   wf  the switch to select filter method
	   wf=0  FILTER;
	   wf=1  FILTER_9_13;
	   wf=2  FILTER_all13;
	   wf=3  FILTER_noFFT;
8. tend_lin_leap.F90 added  tend_lin using leaping format  wbd & CH
9. tend_adv_leap.F90 added  tend_adv using leaping format  wbd & CH
10. tend_lin2_leap.F90 added  tend_lin2 using leaping format  wbd & CH
11. tend_adv2_leap.F90 added  tend_adv2 using leaping format  wbd & CH
