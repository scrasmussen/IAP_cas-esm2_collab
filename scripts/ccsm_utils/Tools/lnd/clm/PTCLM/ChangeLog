Initial version of PTCLM python script for use with cesm1_0_3.

PTCLM is a python tool built on top of CESM1.0 for running CLM "I" cases
for supported single-point grids, and for data from Ameriflux Tower-sites,
or other user-supplied single-point datasets.

Data for the US-UMB Fluxtower site are available in the CESM inputdata repository.
